## Introduction

This proposal introduces first-class support for
**Geospatial Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)** in OpenUSD.
It defines two new schemas that allow USD scenes to declare
*where on a celestial body* their 3D content is located,
enabling interoperability with GIS, AECO, digital twin,
and simulation workflows that require real-world positioning.

The core idea is simple:
a CRS definition is stored as an OGC WKT string on a typed prim,
and an applied API schema binds that CRS to any `UsdGeomXformable` prim
in the scene hierarchy.
Child prims inherit their parent's CRS binding,
and a runtime reprojection pipeline transforms geometry
between different CRS zones within a single composed stage.

This proposal is the result of collaborative work
within the AOUSD AECO Interest Group,
with contributions from Esri, Pixar, NVIDIA, Bentley, and Trimble.

## Motivation

### The geospatial gap in OpenUSD

OpenUSD provides a powerful scene description framework
with rich support for geometry, materials, lighting, and physics.
However, it currently has no mechanism to express
*where a scene is located in or on a celestial body*.

A building model authored in USD can describe its shape,
appearance, and internal structure in exquisite detail —
but there is no standard way to say
"this building sits at 34.0561°N, 117.1956°W"
or "these coordinates are in UTM zone 11N."

This is not a niche requirement.
Every AECO project, every digital twin,
every GIS visualization, and every urban simulation
needs to place 3D content at real-world coordinates.
Without a standard mechanism, each tool and pipeline
invents its own custom metadata,
leading to data loss at interchange boundaries
and preventing true interoperability.

### The expanding scope of USD

USD was originally designed for film production workflows,
where scenes exist in an abstract coordinate space
and absolute position on the Earth is irrelevant.

As USD adoption expands into AECO, GIS, defense, simulation,
and digital twin applications through the AOUSD alliance,
the need for geospatial positioning has become critical.
These industries routinely work with coordinate reference systems,
and their tools (ArcGIS, QGIS, FME, Bentley, Trimble, etc.)
all expect CRS metadata on imported geometry.

The glTF format has already recognized this need
with its own geospatial extension proposal.
IFC 5 is evaluating USD as a potential foundation.
OpenUSD must provide a standard answer
to the question "where is this scene?"

## Problem statement

### Placing 3D content on a celestial body

To place a 3D model at a real-world location, three things are needed:

1. **A Coordinate Reference System (CRS)** that defines
   the mathematical relationship between coordinates and positions
   on the Earth's surface (e.g., "UTM zone 11N" or "WGS 84 geographic").

2. **Coordinates** in that CRS
   (e.g., Easting = 481,948.63 m, Northing = 3,768,393.52 m).

3. **A binding mechanism** that associates the CRS
   with the geometry in the scene graph.

USD currently provides none of these as first-class features.
Users must fall back to custom metadata, primvars,
or out-of-band sidecar files to convey this information —
all of which are opaque to USD's composition engine,
rendering pipeline, and standard tooling.

### Why this matters now

1. **Data loss at interchange boundaries.**
   CRS metadata stored in `customData` or proprietary attributes
   is routinely stripped during USD export/import cycles
   across different tools.

2. **No standard for CRS inheritance.**
   Without a defined inheritance model,
   every prim in a large scene must redundantly carry CRS metadata,
   or tools must implement ad-hoc resolution logic.

3. **Precision hazards.**
   Geographic coordinates (e.g., UTM easting of 481,948 m)
   exceed the useful range of `float32`.
   Without guidance, implementations store these values
   in `point3f` arrays, causing visible jitter and drift.

4. **Multi-CRS composition is undefined.**
   Real-world projects routinely combine data from different CRS zones
   (e.g., a cross-state pipeline project spanning UTM zones 11 and 12).
   There is no mechanism to compose these into a single USD stage
   with correct spatial alignment.

5. **Industry adoption is blocked.**
   GIS vendors, AECO tool makers, and digital twin platforms
   cannot fully adopt USD without a standard way to express CRS,
   because it is a foundational requirement for their workflows.

## Background: Coordinate Reference Systems

This section provides context for readers unfamiliar with geospatial concepts.

### Geographic vs. Projected CRS

A **Geographic CRS** uses angular coordinates
(latitude and longitude in degrees)
on a mathematical model of the Earth's shape (an ellipsoid).
Example: WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) — the CRS used by GPS.

A **Projected CRS** mathematically projects
the curved Earth surface onto a flat 2D plane.
Coordinates are linear (metres or feet).
Example: UTM zone 11N (EPSG:32611) — used for Southern California.

Every projected CRS contains a base geographic CRS,
a projection method (e.g., Transverse Mercator, Lambert Conformal Conic),
and projection parameters (central meridian, scale factor, false easting, etc.).

### CRS encodings: OGC WKT, EPSG, and WKID

There are several ways to identify a CRS:

| Encoding | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **EPSG code** | Integer ID from the IOGP geodesy registry | `32611` |
| **WKID** | Well-Known ID — same concept, used by Esri (includes Esri-specific codes beyond EPSG) | `32611` |
| **OGC WKT** | Self-contained text string defining the full CRS (ISO 19162:2019) | `PROJCRS["WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N", ...]` |
| **PROJ string** | Compact string for the PROJ library | `+proj=utm +zone=11 +datum=WGS84` |

This proposal uses **OGC WKT 2** (ISO 19162:2019)
as the canonical CRS encoding,
with EPSG authority identifiers embedded within the WKT via `ID["EPSG", code]`.

### 3D CRS types

All CRS definitions in this proposal must be 3D.
The supported types are:

| Type | WKT Keyword | Axes | Example |
|------|-------------|------|---------|
| 3D Projected | `COMPOUNDCRS` (PROJCRS + VERTCRS) | Easting, Northing, Up | NAD83 / UTM 11N + NAVD88 height |
| 3D Geographic | `GEOGCRS` with 3 axes | Lat, Lon, Height | WGS 84 (EPSG:4979) |
| 3D Geocentric (ECEF) | `GEODCRS` | X, Y, Z | ITRF2020 |
| 3D Engineering / Local | `DERIVEDPROJCRS` | Local X, Y, Z | Site calibration grid |

3D means a complete vertical reference, not an assumed one. A definition that
names only a horizontal coordinate system does not become 3D by being authored
on a prim whose translate has three components: the third number would carry no
datum and no unit, and two readers would be free to take it as ellipsoidal or
orthometric height. A runtime handed a 2D definition reports failure rather than
supplying the missing half.

For dynamic datums (time-dependent reference frames),
WKT 2 supports the `COORDINATEMETADATA` wrapper
with `FRAMEEPOCH` and `EPOCH` clauses
for high-precision applications.

## Case study for the WGS 84 approach

WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) became dominant mainly because GPS uses it natively — every GPS receiver outputs coordinates in this datum. It is a global geodetic reference, so unlike national datums it works anywhere on Earth with one definition. The web mapping ecosystem reinforced this: GeoJSON mandates it, and most APIs and OGC standards default to it. Being a simple longitude/latitude geographic CRS makes it human-readable and easy to re-project from.

### Eiffel Tower example

Currently, OpenUSD georeferencing relies on stage-level metadata to define the relationship between virtual and physical space. Consider a high-fidelity model of the Eiffel Tower:

- Metrics: Authored at a scale of `metersPerUnit = 1.0`.
- Orientation: Configured as Y-Up, a common legacy default in many DCC tools.
- Coordinates: Vertex positions use 32-bit single-precision floats (`float3`).
- Local Origin: To avoid "floating-point jitter" caused by large coordinate values, the center of the square base is placed at `(0,0,0)`.

![Eiffel Tower](./eiffel_tower.png)

### WGS 84 georeferencing approach

The [omniGeospatial](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/kit/docs/omni.usd.schema.geospatial/0.0.1/USD_SCHEMAS.html) schema (and [Hydra plugin](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/OpenUSD-plugin-samples/tree/main/src/hydra-plugins#creating-a-custom-hydra-20-scene-index-for-geospatially-aware-transforms) as introduced by Nvidia Omniverse) georeferences such a model by applying a `WGS84ReferencePositionAPI` to a parent `Xform` prim.

This establishes a global anchor using:

- Latitude: 48.8584 N
- Longitude: 2.2945 E
- Altitude: 33.0 m (Height above the WGS84 ellipsoid).

The runtime engine then performs an Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF) conversion and a rotation into a Local Tangent Plane, such as East-North-Up (ENU).

### Limitations of only using a WGS 84 anchor point

While likely sufficient for visual effects work, the above method is inadequate for high-precision Survey and Construction for two primary reasons:

1. Datum Ambiguity: The term "WGS84" technically denotes a Datum Ensemble with an inherent low accuracy of approximately 2 meters. WGS84 coordinates are dynamic, changing over time due to tectonic plate motions, and up to 10 cm per year. For WGS84 coordinates to be accurate, they must be provided with the corresponding realization and measurement epoch (e.g., "WGS 84 (G2296) at epoch 2026.25"). This necessary detail is currently unsupported in standard USD schemas.

2. Axis Orientation: The current definition of "USD North" lacks the precision needed to align with the "True North" of a national geodetic Coordinate Reference System (CRS). Furthermore, AECO projects often require heights to be referenced to the geoid (orthometric height) for gravity-dependent systems, such as drainage. Current USD methods cannot precisely align with local vertical systems (like IGN 69) or map projections (like Lambert 93), which for example are the official systems used for AECO projects in France.

## Encoding the CRS: OGC WKT 2.1.11

We propose updating the OpenUSD schema to support describing the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) as a self-contained [WKT v2.1.11](https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-010r11/18-010r11.pdf) string ("Well-known text representation of coordinate reference systems"). This is equivalent to [ISO 19162:2019](https://www.iso.org/standard/76496.html).

This section covers the encoding only. The schema that carries it, and how a
CRS binds to the scene graph, are in [Design overview](#design-overview) and
[Detailed design](#detailed-design) below.

Key benefits:

- Standardization: Uses a mature, ISO-compliant format widely adopted in GIS and engineering.
- Self-Contained: Encodes all necessary parameters (ellipsoid, datum, projection, and units) in a single string, eliminating runtime database dependencies.
- Precision: Supports accurate definition of any Coordinate Reference Systems.

### WKT examples

The two examples here are worked against the case study. Reference encodings
of common CRS types are in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-wkt-examples).

#### WGS 84 ENU (east-north-up) local tangent plane

The following WKT string could be used to replace the approach using `WGS84ReferencePositionAPI` (see [case study](#case-study-for-the-wgs-84-approach) above). It defines a 3D local coordinate system centered at the Eiffel Tower with a Y-Up orientation. Note that this example encodes the up axis in the CRS itself, while [Stage metadata: metersPerUnit and upAxis](#stage-metadata-metersperunit-and-upaxis) below recommends `upAxis = "Z"` for geospatial scenes, and the worked examples in this document set it. Which of the two carries the up axis is [open question 1](#open-questions).

```lisp
GEODCRS["Y-Up Local Tangent Plane at Eiffel Tower",
    BASEGEOGCRS["WGS 84",
        DATUM["World Geodetic System 1984",
            ELLIPSOID["WGS 84", 6378137, 298.257223563, LENGTHUNIT["metre", 1]],
            ID["EPSG", 6326]],
        ID["EPSG", 4979]],
    DERIVINGCONVERSION["Topocentric at Eiffel Tower",
        METHOD["Geographic/topocentric conversions", ID["EPSG", 9837]],
        PARAMETER["Latitude of topocentric origin", 48.8584,
            ANGLEUNIT["degree", 0.0174532925199433], ID["EPSG", 8834]],
        PARAMETER["Longitude of topocentric origin", 2.2945,
            ANGLEUNIT["degree", 0.0174532925199433], ID["EPSG", 8835]],
        PARAMETER["Ellipsoidal height of topocentric origin", 33.0,
            LENGTHUNIT["metre", 1.0], ID["EPSG", 8836]]],
    CS[Cartesian, 3],
    AXIS["X", east], AXIS["Y", up], AXIS["Z", south],
    LENGTHUNIT["metre", 1]]
```

These two examples show what WKT can express. Their Y-up and south-pointing
axes sit outside the authoring convention in
[What a resolved world transform is](#what-a-resolved-world-transform-is), which
is canonical east-north-up with `upAxis = "Z"`; supporting them would mean
specifying their complete axis mapping first.

#### Derived CRS with affine site calibration

For projects requiring high accuracy, we can compute the transformation between the National CRS (e.g., Lambert-93 + IGN69) and the USD local CRS using least squares. This transformation—which can include affine transformations (EPSG 9624) and vertical adjustment planes to account for localized vertical deviations—can be encoded directly into the WKT string.

## Design overview

### Principles

1. **Industry agnosticism.**
   The CRS mechanism must serve GIS, AECO, M&E, simulation,
   and defense equally — no single industry's conventions are privileged.

2. **Self-contained CRS definitions.**
   A USD file must carry all information needed to interpret its coordinates
   without relying on external registry lookups at runtime.

3. **Composition-friendly.**
   CRS definitions and bindings must compose correctly
   through all USD composition arcs (references, sublayers, inherits, etc.).

4. **Inheritance.**
   Child prims should inherit their parent's CRS,
   just as they inherit material bindings.
   Overrides at any level in the hierarchy are supported.

5. **Precision-aware.**
   The design must address the float32 limitation
   of `point3f` geometry by separating large geospatial offsets
   (double-precision transforms) from local vertex positions (single-precision).

6. **Minimal disruption.**
   No changes to existing USD schemas or core APIs.
   The geospatial schemas are additive and optional.

7. **Extensible.**
   Third-party CRS libraries (PROJ, GDAL, Esri, Trimble)
   are abstracted behind an internal API.
   OpenUSD itself does not validate or interpret WKT strings.

8. **Interoperable.**
   The design should facilitate round-trip exchange
   with glTF (geospatial extension), IFC, CityGML, and OGC 3D Tiles.

### Schema design

Two new schemas are introduced:

| Schema | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `CoordinateReferenceSystem` | Typed (IsA) | Defines a CRS as a first-class USD prim |
| `CRSBindingAPI` | Applied (HasA) | Binds a CRS prim to a `UsdGeomXformable` |

This two-schema approach separates the CRS *definition*
from the CRS *usage*,
so that a single CRS definition is named by many prims
rather than copied onto each of them.
A CRS library layer is brought into a scene the usual way, by reference or
sublayer; the binding itself is a relationship and composes as one.

### CRS library pattern

CRS definitions are intended to live in shared **library layers**
(e.g., `crs_library.usda`) that can be referenced by any scene:

```
crs_library.usda
├── /CRS/WGS84_UTM11N        (CoordinateReferenceSystem)
├── /CRS/NAD83_UTM11N        (CoordinateReferenceSystem)
├── /CRS/NAD83_CA_Zone5      (CoordinateReferenceSystem)
└── /CRS/WGS84_Geographic3D  (CoordinateReferenceSystem)
```

This pattern is analogous to shared material libraries in M&E workflows.
Authoring tools can ship standard CRS libraries,
and users can create custom ones for local/site-specific CRS definitions.

### CRS binding and inheritance

The `CRSBindingAPI` is applied to a `UsdGeomXformable` prim.
It declares one relationship, `crs:binding`, targeting a
`CoordinateReferenceSystem` prim on the same stage or in a layer the stage
composes.

CRS bindings inherit down the prim hierarchy.
A prim without its own binding resolves its CRS by walking up to the nearest
ancestor that has one, and that nearest binding wins outright.
`UsdShadeMaterialBindingAPI` works the same way, and the resemblance stops
there: there are no purpose-restricted bindings, no collection-based bindings
and no binding-strength metadata. What those add is a way for several bindings
to compete for one prim, which for an appearance is ordinary authoring and for a
coordinate reference system means somebody is wrong about what the coordinates
mean. That is for a checker to catch, not for a precedence order to resolve.

A child prim may override its parent's CRS
by applying its own `CRSBindingAPI` targeting a different CRS.
This is how multi-CRS scenes are composed
(e.g., one subtree in UTM zone 11N, another in UTM zone 18N).

### Precision handling

USD mesh geometry uses `point3f[]` (float32),
which provides ~7 decimal digits of precision.
A UTM easting of 481,948.63 requires 8+ significant digits,
so storing geospatial coordinates directly in `point3f` causes visible artifacts.

The solution is a two-tier approach:

| Tier | Data | Type | Precision |
|------|------|------|-----------|
| **Anchor** | Geospatial position | `double3 xformOp:translate` | float64 (~15 digits) |
| **Detail** | Mesh vertices | `point3f[] points` | float32 (~7 digits) |

The large CRS coordinates are carried in the double-precision
`xformOp:translate` on the CRS-bound `Xform` prim.
Mesh vertex positions are small offsets (typically < 1 km)
relative to that anchor, staying well within float32 range.

## Detailed design

### CoordinateReferenceSystem typed schema

A concrete typed schema that defines a CRS as a first-class USD prim.

**Prim type name:** `CoordinateReferenceSystem`

**Attributes:**

| Attribute | API Name | Type | Variability | Description |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `crs:wkt` | `wellKnownText` | `uniform token` | Uniform | OGC WKT 2 string (ISO 19162:2019) defining the CRS |

The `crs:wkt` attribute is `uniform` because a CRS definition
does not vary over time or across a mesh.
It is a `token` (not `string`) to enable efficient caching and comparison.

**USDA syntax:**

```usda
def CoordinateReferenceSystem "WGS84_UTM11N" (
    doc = "WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N (EPSG:32611) + EGM2008 height (EPSG:3855)"

### CRSBindingAPI applied schema

A single-apply API schema that binds a CRS to a `UsdGeomXformable` prim.

**Schema type name:** `CRSBindingAPI`
**Can only apply to:** `Xformable`

**Relationships:**

| Relationship | API Name | Targets | Description |
|--------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `crs:binding` | `crsBinding` | one `CoordinateReferenceSystem` prim | The CRS the bound prim's coordinates are expressed in |

A relationship rather than a reference. A reference would compose the CRS prim's
contents into the bound prim, putting `crs:wkt` on geometry and copying the
definition to every site that uses it; a relationship names the definition and
leaves it in one place.

Relationship targets compose as a list, not as a scalar. `Bind()` authors an
explicit one-target list, and an explicit list in a stronger layer does replace
what weaker layers contributed. An ordinary target addition does not: it
composes with them, so a prim can end up carrying two targets without any single
layer having authored two. Exactly one composed target is expected. An empty
target list and multiple targets are both authoring errors rather than an
unbinding mechanism, which is what keeps a choice between two CRS definitions
from being settled by the order they happen to compose in.

**Binding does not modify the prim's transform stack.** `Bind()` authors the
relationship and nothing else. That a bound prim's `xformOp:translate` reads as
an absolute position in the bound CRS is a rule the runtime applies when it
resolves; it is not recorded in the layer. See
[Transform stack and resetXformStack](#transform-stack-and-resetxformstack).

### Complete scene example

The following example places a simplified building
at the Esri headquarters in Redlands, California (34.0561°N, 117.1956°W),
using WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N (EPSG:32611) compounded with EGM2008 height
(EPSG:3855), so the translate's third component carries a datum and a unit.

```usda

    upAxis = "Z"
)

    # Esri HQ — UTM 11N coordinates (metres)

                point3f[] points = [
                    (-25,-15,0),(25,-15,0),(25,15,0),(-25,15,0),

                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Key observations:
- `/World` is bound to UTM 11N (EPSG:32611) — this is the **Target CRS**.
- `/World/EsriCampus` has no CRS binding — it **inherits** UTM 11N from `/World`.
- `/World/NewYorkCity` overrides with UTM 18N (EPSG:32618).
  At runtime, its geometry would be **reprojected** to UTM 11N.
- Mesh vertices (`point3f[]`) are small local offsets.
  Large geospatial positions are in `double3 xformOp:translate`.

## Runtime coordinate transformation

### When coordinates must be harmonized

There are several runtime situations where coordinates defined in different CRS need to be harmonized:

- rendering
- stage queries (e.g. bounding boxes)
- indirect transformation requests (e.g. upon stage flattening)
- explicit transformation requests using the new API calls

### The transformation abstraction

We propose to introduce an internal abstraction to compute coordinate transformations from one CRS to another:

```text
Status transform(inout ArrayVector3d coordinates, in WKT crsIn, in WKT crsOut)
```

The OpenUSD plugin system is employed to register implementations.

**A conversion reports whether it succeeded, and a failed conversion yields no
placement.** The abstraction stays as narrow as it is — it moves coordinates and
nothing else — but a call that returns nothing cannot be told apart from a call
that did nothing, and the runtime above it is required to report failure rather
than place content it could not convert.

**Converting an array is all or nothing.** A call that cannot convert every
input fails, rather than returning some inputs converted and the rest untouched.
An untouched coordinate is indistinguishable from a converted one: for a
conversion that shifts by 1000 m, a two-point batch whose second point falls
outside the operation's domain of validity and is left in place returns a
perfectly plausible number 1000 m from the intended one, in an array the caller
has been told succeeded.

**`Status` carries which coordinate operation ran and what accuracy the engine
attributes to it.** Success alone does not identify the operation, and two
operations between the same pair of CRSs can differ legitimately — two datum
operations put the same anchor 2 m apart in exact arithmetic, before any
floating-point behaviour enters. Where a required resource is unavailable that
is a failure, not a quiet substitution of a lower-accuracy operation that
reports success.

A per-element status interface, and recovering the elements that could be
converted, are optimizations an implementation can add later without changing
any of the above.

### Target CRS and runtime reprojection

The **Target CRS** for a resolve pass is the one supplied by the host
application or API caller, or where the caller supplies none, the CRS bound to
the composed `defaultPrim` of the root layer stack. All prims whose bound CRS
differs from it are **reprojected** — their transforms are mathematically
converted from the source CRS to the Target CRS.

A Hydra 2.0 Scene Index Filter for rendering and API methods for computation are
both ways to implement this, over an abstracted interface to third-party CRS
libraries (PROJ, GDAL, Esri projection engine, and others). [Runtime
behavior](#runtime-behavior) below describes what any implementation has to
produce, without assuming either.

### Runtime behavior

The rules here are stated on their own terms. Where a choice could plausibly
have been made another way, what the other way costs has been measured on a real
scene rather than estimated; those figures, and the implementations they come
from, are in
[Appendix C](#appendix-c-reference-implementations-and-measurements), which is
not part of this description.

#### Which CRS applies to a prim

The binding is the `crs:binding` relationship declared by `CRSBindingAPI`.
Composition and binding stay orthogonal and both use mechanisms USD already has:
the relationship is the binding edge, and the CRS prim it points at may itself
have arrived by a `references` or `payload` arc from a shared library layer.
Nothing bespoke, and no asset-path attribute in the binding path.

A prim's CRS is found by walking from the prim toward the root of the composed
stage and taking the nearest authored binding. A georeferenced scene binds at its
root, so every prim in it inherits one — a prim with nothing bound at or above it
is a scene with content outside its own frame, which is an authoring defect rather
than a mode this description supports.

Where several ancestors carry bindings, the nearest one wins. There is no
further ladder: no purpose-restricted bindings, no collection-based bindings, no
binding strength by which an ancestor overrides its descendants, and no analogue
of `GeomSubsets`.

Those mechanisms exist so that several bindings can compete for one prim, and
that is the wrong shape here. A material binding assigns an appearance, which is
arbitrary and legitimately multi-valued — the same mesh can have a preview look
and a final look, which is what purposes are for. A CRS binding records what a
prim's coordinates already mean, and there is one answer. A preview CRS is not a
thing; the variability that would reach for one is a choice of **target**, which
is a caller's parameter and is described below. Collection bindings would also
cost the property that makes resolution cheap to reason about: the answer for a
prim is found by walking its ancestors and stopping, where a collection anywhere
on the stage could otherwise claim it. And two different bindings competing for
one prim does not mean a precedence question, it means somebody is wrong about
what the coordinates mean — which a checker should catch rather than a ladder
silently settle.

What is reused is the part worth reusing: someone who understands material
binding already understands this one. Nearest authored binding wins.

It also means inheriting the cost shape. Resolving a prim's CRS is an ancestor
walk, a relationship hop to a prim that may be anywhere in the composed stage, and
then turning a WKT string into something that can transform coordinates — the last
dominating, and none of it worth repeating per prim. `UsdShadeMaterialBindingAPI`
has the same shape and answers it with caches passed through resolution.

#### Which CRS the scene resolves into

Everything in a single resolve pass lands in one target CRS: the one supplied by
the host application or API caller, or where the caller supplies none, the CRS
bound to the composed `defaultPrim` of the root layer stack. A caller-supplied
target is what lets two georeferenced stages with different `defaultPrim`
bindings be brought into one scene, and it is the case the PROJ example above
already demonstrates by transforming into EPSG:10499.

Where neither is available — a stage carrying CRS bindings with nothing bound to
its `defaultPrim`, opened without a target — there is no default to fall back
on. Picking one silently would place the whole scene somewhere nobody asked for,
so this is handled the same way as any other transform that cannot be computed,
and it is an authoring-time error a checker catches.

A prim whose CRS already *is* the target skips the CRS-to-CRS point conversion
rather than being sent on an identity round trip through the transformation
engine, which would only introduce noise into content that needed no work. It
skips nothing else: anchor detection, absolute placement, the anchor frame, unit
conversion and the factoring of the output transform all still apply. Same CRS
does not mean no work — the explicit-anchor rule holds whether or not a
conversion runs.

#### What an anchor establishes

The nearest prim at or above a given prim that carries **its own** binding and an
authored anchor translate is that prim's **anchor**. What the anchor contributes
to the prim's world transform is a *frame* — orientation and translation — not
just a position.

An anchor's `xformOpOrder` holds exactly one operation, an active authored
`double3 xformOp:translate`, optionally preceded by `!resetXformStack!`.
Rotation, scale, pivots, further translations and general matrix operations
belong on ordinary children.

The restriction is there because "the authored transform" and "the translate"
are not the same number, and reading one where the other was meant is silent. An
anchor authored `[rotateZ 90°, translate (100,0,0)]` has an ordinary local origin
at `(0,100,0)`; taking the raw translate as the absolute position puts it at
`(100,0,0)`, 141.42 m away, and both readings can be argued from a rule that
says only "an authored transform". The reverse order `[translate, rotateZ]` does
put the origin at `(100,0,0)`, but dropping the rotation still swings a
ten-metre child by 14.14 m. A pivot pair — pivot `(10,0,0)`, `rotateZ 90°`,
inverse pivot — puts the origin at `(10,-10,0)`, which no single op in the stack
resembles. And a translate attribute that is not listed in `xformOpOrder`
contributes nothing at all, so a resolver that scans for translate-like
properties reads a position the stage does not have.

None of those stacks are exotic; they are what a DCC writes. The alternative to
the restriction is a rule for factoring an arbitrary stack into a geospatial
position and a remainder, which has no good answer once the coordinates are
partly angular — whether the position is the evaluated origin, one distinguished
op, or a factor of the composed matrix, and what the rest of the affine part
then means. Keeping the anchor a translation-only `Xform` puts the arbitrary
stack on the child, where it is ordinary USD and nothing has to interpret it.

A stack that does not meet this is diagnosed rather than partially interpreted,
and so is a binding with no anchor translate. A translate of `(0,0,0)` is a
valid anchor wherever zero is a valid coordinate in that CRS; it is a position,
not missing data. An opinion that arrived by reference, sublayer or inherit is
authored on the composed prim like any other, and where it came from does not
disqualify it.

A binding therefore does two things, and they are worth separating because the
material-binding parallel suggests the wrong answer on the second. An **inherited**
binding says which coordinate reference system this part of the scene is expressed
in. A binding **authored on the prim itself** additionally says that this prim's
transform is a position in that system rather than an offset within its parent's
frame — and that holds even when the system is the one it would have inherited
anyway. Re-binding the same material is a no-op; re-binding the same CRS is what
makes a prim an anchor.

This is the most consequential thing in the section, and the naive
implementation gets it wrong in a way that looks right at first. That
implementation reprojects the anchor position and writes it into the translation
of an otherwise identity matrix, which is correct exactly where the source and
target axes happen to align. Everywhere else the subtree keeps world `+Z` when
its local `+Z` should point along the ellipsoidal normal at the anchor — at
mid-latitudes, tens of degrees away from geocentric `+Z`. The result is not
subtle: assets lie on their side, and a building offset from its anchor lands
well away from where closed-form geodesy puts it.

Which frame the anchor establishes follows from the kind of CRS it is bound to —
the *source* CRS, which the runtime already has in hand:

| Anchor's CRS | Frame it establishes | What descendant offsets mean |
|---|---|---|
| Geographic or geocentric | The topocentric (east-north-up) basis at the anchor position, originating at that position expressed in the target CRS | Local metric offsets in that topocentric frame |
| Projected (UTM, State Plane, site-calibrated, …) | The anchor's grid plane | Offsets in the anchor's grid coordinates and units |

Grid axes are not topocentric axes — they differ by grid convergence and by
point scale — so lifting a grid-authored offset through a true east-north-up
basis produces a systematic error that grows with the lever from the anchor to
the geometry. Selecting the frame from the *source* CRS is what removes it.

This is also most of the answer to the objection that composing a local
transform onto an anchor position "is not correct in the general case for a
spherical target CRS." Choosing the composition frame from the source CRS
removes the part of that error that was a choice. What is left is the
approximation stated below, which is bounded and measured rather than open.

A prim carrying its *own* position and binding is an anchor in its own right,
and its ancestors' georeferencing does not additionally accumulate onto it: two
georeferenced positions in one chain are two absolute statements, not a base and
an offset. That makes anchor-versus-child a real authoring distinction, and
getting it wrong is the most common way to misplace a georeferenced scene.
Authoring a building corner as an independent georeferenced leaf, where relative
placement was intended, misplaces it by the whole distance between the two
georeferenced positions; re-authoring it as an ordinary Cartesian child places
it exactly.

#### What a resolved world transform is

**A resolved world matrix is an affine approximation about its anchor.** At each
evaluation time the runtime computes one affine map from the anchor's source
coordinate domain into the output Cartesian frame, and every ordinary descendant
composes its unchanged local-to-anchor matrix onto that same map. Descendant
origins are not converted one at a time.

Write `g_A(d)` for the conversion of a displacement `d`, expressed in the
anchor's source frame as the table above defines it, into output Cartesian
coordinates, units and axes included. For a projected anchor that is the CRS
conversion of `a + d`; for a geographic or geocentric anchor it is the
conversion of the point reached by lifting `d` through the anchor's
east-north-up basis in the source geocentric space. Then, with row vectors:

```text
b_A = g_A(0)        the anchor's position in the output frame
J_A = Dg_A(0)       the derivative of the conversion there
F_A = the affine map with linear part J_A and translation b_A

world(D, t) = localToAnchor(D, t) * F_A(t)
```

`localToAnchor(D)` is `D`'s ordinary authored transform relative to `A`, from the
standard `UsdGeomXformable` stack, with no geospatial interpretation applied to
it at all. Below the anchor, everything is plain USD — and one map per anchor is
what makes that true rather than nearly true.

**The cost, stated and measured.** The map is exact at the anchor and its error
is second order in the distance from it. Source UTM 31N promoted to 3D, target
WGS 84 geocentric, anchor at `(500000, 0, 0)`: a point 1 km along the grid east
axis converts exactly to `(6369343.549664, 334804.923976, 0)` m and resolves
through the anchor frame to `(6369343.628009, 334804.928089, 0)` m — 7.85 cm
apart. That is the difference between a curved map and its tangent. No amount of
precision reduces it, and it is reported separately from transformation-engine
error because the two have different causes and different remedies.

Second order in distance makes this a locality budget rather than a correctness
problem. A stated maximum displacement error implies a maximum anchored extent,
and content larger than that is authored as several anchored regions — which is
tiling, and is what georeferenced data already does for reasons that have
nothing to do with this. Adjacent anchors approximate a shared edge from
opposite directions and need not close there. This description sets no number:
an implementation states the extent over which its frames hold to a stated
error, and a deliverable states the budget it was authored to.

**Why one map and not a conversion per descendant.** Two encodings of the same
marker — a geometry point at `(1000, 0, 0)` on an identity child, and the same
point at the origin of a child translated `(1000, 0, 0)` — are the same
placement in ordinary USD, and moving a displacement between an op and a vertex
is an ordinary asset refactor. A rule that converts descendant origins while
leaving vertices as local offsets puts those two encodings in different places,
so reparenting a light or collapsing an op moves the building. One map per
anchor is what keeps them equal, and with them rigid assets, cameras, instancing,
inverse and relative queries, and ordinary bounds.

**The linear part is not optional and is not an orthonormal basis.** `J_A`
carries the rotation between the source and target grids and the unit scale
between them, and both change where a descendant lands.

Units first. A projected anchor on a foot grid in a metre stage translates
`1000` grid units; a child marker sits `10` further along. The physical position
is `1010 × 1200/3937 = 307.848616` m. Converting the anchor alone and adding the
raw offset gives `304.800610 + 10 = 314.800610` m — 6.95 m out, at ten feet from
the anchor. The offset passes through `J_A` like everything else. Mixed
horizontal and vertical units convert component-wise rather than by one scalar,
and a combination that cannot be expressed that way is a failure rather than an
approximation.

Rotation second, and this is where a planar target is not the easy case it
looks. Take a site conversion that turns the grid a quarter turn:
`F(x, y, z) = (−y, x, z)`. An anchor at `(100, 200, 0)` with a child tip `10`
along source `+x` has ordinary source world point `(110, 200, 0)`, which converts
to `(−200, 110, 0)`. A frame carrying position only puts it at `(−190, 100, 0)`
— 14.14 m away, with no curvature and no geocentric target anywhere in the
problem. An anchor's orientation is implicit in the target's grid only when the
source and target grids are the same grid. Scale and shear in a site conversion
survive in `J_A` for the same reason. Authored child rotations and scales are
unchanged as factors; their resolved world effect is not independent of the map.

**Axes.** Geographic anchor tuples are longitude, latitude, height; conventional
projected tuples are easting, northing, height; geocentric tuples are geocentric
X, Y, Z. The engine adapter normalizes once, at the boundary. For a geocentric
anchor the local axes are the east-north-up basis the table above gives and not
geocentric X, Y, Z: a child offset `(10, 0, 0)` under an anchor at
`(6378137, 0, 0)` points east, along geocentric `+Y`, and reading it along `+X`
is 14.14 m away even when source and target CRS are the same one.

This version's authoring convention is canonical east-north-up local anchor axes
with `upAxis = "Z"`. A WKT axis assignment that does not map onto it needs an
explicit supported mapping or a diagnostic, and an imported Y-up asset is
corrected by an ordinary rotation beneath the anchor — stage up-axis metadata
does not apply that rotation itself, and a Y-up tip at `(0, 10, 0)` is 14.14 m
from the Z-up `(0, 0, 10)` it was meant to be.

**Exact point conversion is a separate operation.** A world matrix is affine and
a CRS conversion is not, so a matrix cannot carry the conversion. The choice was
never between exact transforms and approximate ones; it was between an
approximate transform and no transform, and with no transform there are no
bounds, no physics, no instancing and no round trip through a DCC. Exactness is
relocated rather than given up: converting a point exactly stays available as
its own operation, returning coordinates in the requested CRS, and that is where
a survey question is answered. Where the geometry itself has to be exact across
a long extent, the answer is a reprojected representation baked with its error
budget stated, or smaller anchored regions — not a world matrix promising
something it cannot represent.

An implementation may compute `J_A` analytically or by controlled numerical
differentiation, and states the accuracy of the frame it produced. What it does
not do is substitute an unrelated orthonormal basis and report success. A source
map that is not defined and differentiable over the extent in use does not yield
a frame, and that is a reported failure like any other.

**Bounds come from the same representation.** Resolved bounds are computed from
the resolved matrices, at the same evaluation time and in the same output frame
as the transforms they accompany. An extent authored in a prim's own frame stays
valid, because resolution does not move geometry within that frame — a unit
box's local `[−0.5, +0.5]` is as useful afterwards as before. An extent computed
over source-space world positions does not survive: that same box under an
anchor at 100 and an independently anchored parent at 20 has a source world
interval of `[119.5, 120.5]` and a resolved one of `[19.5, 20.5]`, so a
source-space aggregate hint reused as though it were resolved is 100 m out.

Local extents stay local and in float and global placement stays in the
double-precision matrices, for the same reason the geometry does. At
`6378137.1` m a float32 rounds away about 0.1 m, where a float32 offset of `0.1`
under a double translation of that magnitude holds to around 2 × 10⁻⁹ m.
Rebuilding a world-space `float3[] extent` would hand back exactly the precision
the two-tier scheme exists to keep.

#### Inverse and relative queries

A world-to-local query in the resolved view inverts that prim's resolved world
matrix. A relative query between two independently anchored prims uses their
resolved matrices, in the same target frame and at the same evaluation time —
`W(P) * inverse(W(Q))` with row vectors — rather than walking the source
hierarchy across the anchor boundary between them. An inverse world matrix is
the inverse of the affine map; it is not the inverse of exact point conversion.

The gap is the same one as everywhere else in this section. With `/A` at 100 and
an independently anchored `/A/B` at 20, the source local-to-world is `T(120)`,
and its inverse sends the resolved world point 20 to local −100 where the
resolved matrix sends it to local zero. A picking tool cannot invert the source
cache to undo what the resolved view drew.

Where the inverse does not exist the query reports failure rather than returning
something. A child scale of `(0, 1, 1)` sends both `(8, 2, 0)` and `(0, 2, 0)`
to the same point and no inverse recovers which was meant;
`GfMatrix4d::GetInverse()` returns a sentinel for a singular matrix rather than
a geometric answer, and passing that on as a placement is worse than failing.
Forward evaluation of the same transform is unaffected and stays a separate
operation.

#### Instancing

Point-instance positions and prototype transforms are ordinary local data,
evaluated before the instancer's resolved world transform. A prototype's storage
location does not georeference its instances. `/A` translating 100, with an
instancer holding one position `(3, 0, 0)` referencing `/Library/Tree` whose
local translation is 7, puts that instance at 110, and `/Library`'s own
translation of 1000 does not participate — that is ordinary OpenUSD. A resolver
that georeferences the stored prototype first, because `/Library` happens to
carry an anchor, puts it at 1110 instead.

So in this version a point-instancer prototype subgraph carries no active CRS
anchor. Independently geolocated instances are authored as separately anchored
placements. Native instances share local data and geometry as they always have,
while resolved placement is computed in each instance's composed namespace
context: a shared prototype under anchors at 100 and 200 cannot share a cached
*world* matrix, because a local tip at 1 belongs at 101 in one and 201 in the
other. Local matrices and geometry remain shareable, which is the part that
matters for memory.

A geographic distribution too large for one anchor frame is partitioned into
separately anchored regions — the same locality budget as everywhere else, not a
per-instance CRS attribute.

#### Everything that is not an anchor

A georeferenced scene is a place, and most of what is in it does not carry a
coordinate reference system of its own. A bollard, a light, a piece of survey
equipment sits where it sits, relative to something that does. That does not make
it any less placed on the Earth — it is placed the way things in a place are
placed, relative to their surroundings. Only anchors carry a CRS; everything
beneath one is plain USD, and authoring a scene requires no per-prim geodesy.

Four things follow, and together they are what makes such a scene editable by
someone who does not know what an ellipsoid is.

**A prim without its own binding is placed by its ordinary authored transform,
relative to the nearest anchor above it.** Being in a georeferenced scene changes
nothing about how it is authored, parented, or moved.

**Editing that transform changes where that prim is, and nothing else.** Because
resolution is a computed view and nothing resolved was written into the scene, no
stored placement goes stale and no other prim needs revisiting.

**Moving an anchor moves everything whose transform dependency reaches it;
moving a child does not move its anchor.** Those are different edits with
different reach, and which one is being made is determined by whether the prim
carries its own binding. A descendant that is an anchor in its own right does
not move — the same statement as two georeferenced positions in one chain not
accumulating.

**Binding lookup and transform accumulation are two walks, and only one of them
stops at a reset.** A binding lookup may pass a prim that resets its transform
stack; transform accumulation may not. Where an unbound descendant resets its
stack somewhere between itself and its anchor, its ordinary world position no
longer depends on the anchor, and there is nothing anchor-relative left to
compose. This version reports that as an unsupported configuration: author an
independent anchor there, or remove the reset where relative placement was what
was meant.

The failure it prevents is concrete. `/A` translates 100 and `/A/D` translates
20 and resets its stack; `D`'s ordinary world position is 20.
`ComputeRelativeTransform(D, A)` returns the matrix **and** a reset flag, and
taking the matrix while discarding the flag composes 20 onto a resolved 100 and
places `D` at 120 — 100 m from where the composed stage puts it. OpenUSD already
evaluates `[translate:old=100, !resetXformStack!, translate:new=3]` to 3 rather
than 103. Descendant stack evaluation is OpenUSD's, and the error comes from
re-implementing it simply enough to lose the reset.

Reinterpreting a reset as "reset to the nearest anchor" would be worse than
diagnosing it: it changes what an existing authored scene means, and the content
that carries those resets was authored against the ordinary rule. Namespace
containers that are not `Xformable` are not reset boundaries and stop neither
walk; they contribute no local matrix and that is all.

**A prim's frame is determinable from the composed stage without resolving it.** A
tool that needs to know what one metre east means at a particular prim can ask
locally, without a resolve pass over the whole scene.

That last one is what lets a hand edit respect the planet. A Cartesian offset
sits in a frame this description defines precisely, so a tool can work out what a
geodetic intent — stay on the surface, hold this altitude — amounts to as an offset,
and write that. A widget that does the geodesy produces plain numbers; the runtime
that later resolves them knows nothing about the intent and does not need to.

The limit worth stating is that the scene does not record the intent either. Opened
in a tool without that widget, the object still moves — it moves in the frame rather
than along the surface, and nothing marks the difference. That is the same division
this description keeps everywhere: the scene carries state, not behavior.

#### Precision, axis order, units, time and epoch

**Precision.** CRS coordinates, anchor positions, anchor frames and resolved
world transforms are carried in double precision, and resolved absolute
coordinates are not written into single-precision geometry attributes such as
`point3f[] points`. Frame-based composition is what makes this affordable rather
than merely desirable: the large magnitudes — about 6.4 × 10⁶ m for an
Earth-surface geocentric position — stay inside the double-precision anchor
frame, and vertices below the anchor stay small local offsets. Absolute float32
geocentric positions lose accuracy at that magnitude by a margin that matters for
survey work; the same geometry carried as localized float32 offsets under a
double-precision anchor holds it, by orders of magnitude. This is the two-tier
scheme from
[Precision handling](#precision-handling), stated as the runtime's side of the
bargain.

**Axis order.** The anchor position is ordered `(x = longitude or easting,
y = latitude or northing, z = height)` regardless of the axis order the CRS
authority declares in the WKT, and the runtime hands the components to the
transformation engine in that order — the `always_xy` convention — rather than
re-ordering them from the WKT `AXIS` clauses. USD is not the right venue to
relitigate authority axis order. Fixing it at the boundary means a scene reads
the same no matter which authority defined its CRS, and it removes a class of
bug that inspection cannot catch: a transposed easting and northing is usually
still a perfectly valid coordinate.

**Units.** The anchor position is in the units the bound CRS declares, not in
`metersPerUnit`. Where the two differ, the runtime converts when producing world
transforms rather than assuming metres.

**Time.** Anchor positions and ordinary local transforms are resolved at the
caller's `UsdTimeCode`, through the composed stage's own value resolution and
interpolation, and the conversion runs on the values that come back. Not the
other way round.

Converting at the neighbouring samples and interpolating the results is a
different operation, and the difference is not small. A geographic anchor on the
equator swinging from longitude −1° at time code 0 to +1° at time code 2 has the
value `(0°, 0°, 0)` at time code 1, which is `(6378137, 0, 0)` m in WGS 84
geocentric coordinates. Converting the two endpoints and interpolating their
translations gives `(6377165.578842, 0, 0)` m — 971.42 m inward, the midpoint of
a chord rather than a point on the ellipsoid. That is a sampling-order error
rather than engine precision, and no amount of extra precision reduces it.

A uniform CRS definition does not make the frame time-independent. `crs:wkt` is
`uniform` because a CRS does not vary over a mesh or over time; the anchor's
translate does vary, so the frame derived from it is recomputed at each
requested time.

Where a runtime bakes an animation down to matrices it states the interval it
sampled and the approximation that introduces, because interpolating baked
matrices is not the operation the paragraph above describes and nothing
downstream can tell the two apart from the matrices alone.

**Epoch.** Where a CRS carries a coordinate epoch — dynamic datums — the runtime
passes it to the transformation engine as the time coordinate of a 4D transform.
Where none is authored, it does not invent one.

Coordinate epoch is a property of the coordinates and it comes from the CRS's
coordinate metadata. It is not `UsdTimeCode`, it is not derived from
`timeCodesPerSecond`, and it is not the datum's frame reference epoch. Those are
three different quantities, and substituting one for another is silent. Take a
dynamic operation that moves a point by 0.1 m per year: a point at `x = 100` m
with coordinate epoch 2026 resolves to 100.6 m at every animation time where `x`
is fixed. Reading the epoch off time code 24 instead gives −99.6 m, 200.2 m
away. Reading it off the frame epoch of 2020 gives 100 m, 0.6 m away — the
second mistake is the one that reaches production, because nothing about the
result looks wrong.

Both source and target coordinate metadata are carried through to the
transformation engine, which needs them to select an operation at all. An
operation that requires an epoch it was not given reports failure rather than
assuming one. An object with animated coordinates inside a fixed coordinate
epoch is ordinary and is supported; observations at genuinely changing epochs
need an explicit representation later, rather than an interpretation of USD
frames that nobody authored.

#### When the transform cannot be computed

A runtime that implements this description will still meet transforms it cannot
produce: no registered transformation engine, WKT that cannot be parsed or is
unsupported, a missing transformation grid, a point outside the transformation's
domain of validity.

In none of those cases does it fall back to placing the prim at its unresolved
authored transform, or substitute an identity transform. It reports the failure,
and either omits the affected prims or declines the stage.

The reason is that a substituted transform is indistinguishable from a computed
one. A caller that receives a matrix has no way to tell that the geodesy behind it
did not happen, so a quiet fallback converts a missing grid file into content that
is confidently in the wrong place. Reporting keeps the failure where it can be
acted on, and the cost of being wrong here is measured in hundreds of metres
rather than in precision.

What degrades gracefully is the metadata. Where reprojection is unavailable, CRS
definitions and bindings survive read and write round trips even though placement
cannot be computed, so the failure stays recoverable in a tool that does have an
engine.

#### When a consumer cannot resolve at all

A consumer with no CRS support is a different situation, and not one this
description can impose anything on.

What such a consumer sees is worth stating, because it is the reason any of this
matters. A coordinate-neutral scene draws at bare local offsets — near the centre
of the planet rather than on its surface, with nothing raised — and to that
consumer it is indistinguishable from a correct scene. Nothing is malformed;
ordinary transform composition simply answers a question that was never asked of
it.

**So the requirement falls on the stage, not on the consumer: a stage whose
correct placement depends on CRS resolution must be able to declare that
dependency, and a consumer must be able to read the declaration without traversing
the stage.** What a consumer does with it — refuse, defer to a resolver, warn, or
proceed — is its own call. An extension is in no position to oblige runtimes to
behave differently for it, and one that tried would be asking every runtime to
know about every extension in order to know when to object.

Two things follow. The declaration is a contract rather than an enforcement: a
consumer that ignores it still gets it wrong, and nothing here changes that. And
because the dependency is a property of the data rather than an assertion by an
author, it should be derivable rather than remembered — an author who omits it has
a defect a tool can find. The mechanism belongs to the host format, and for
OpenUSD it is described in [Declaring the dependency](#declaring-the-dependency)
below.

#### Where the behavior can run

Nothing above depends on Hydra, on rendering, or on any particular evaluation
architecture. A runtime implements this description by producing these world
transforms, by whatever mechanism. Query paths — bounding boxes, point
instancing, physics, world-transform queries — are the same behavior as
rendering, not a reduced version of it. "Does this work without a renderer" is
the first question a GIS or AECO pipeline asks, and the answer here is
structural rather than a promise: the description is stated over the composed
stage, and nothing in it refers to a render path.

**There are two answers for the same prim, and this names both.** An ordinary
query on the authored stage returns the ordinary answer. `/A` translating 100
with `/A/B` translating 20, both bound and both anchors, puts `/A/B` at 120,
because that is what the authored stack says and `UsdGeomXformable` and
`UsdGeomXformCache` go on saying it. A CRS-resolved query returns 20, because
under the explicit-anchor rule `/A/B` states an absolute position. The two are
100 m apart with no reprojection anywhere in the problem — both prims are bound
to the target.

Neither is wrong; they answer different questions over different things.
Resolution is an explicit conversion from the authored stage into a Cartesian
view in a stated target frame. Queries on the authored stage keep their existing
results unchanged. Queries in the resolved view, or queries that ask for
resolution, get resolved ones, in which every anchor contributes an absolute
matrix and its parent's transform is not applied again.

What cannot be promised is that a consumer reading the authored stage without
knowing about CRS gets georeferenced placement. That is the whole reason a stage
declares the dependency. What is promised is that every reader of the converted
view agrees, and one shared conversion serving render, query, physics and export
is what delivers it.

What the transformation engine is asked to do is narrow, and deliberately so.
The abstraction above it moves coordinates from one CRS to another. Deriving the
anchor's orientation basis, selecting the frame from the kind of source CRS,
localizing offsets, and deciding what happens when a transform cannot be
computed all sit on the runtime's side of that line. An engine that only moves
points is enough to implement everything described here, which is what leaves
PROJ, GDAL and a vendor projection engine interchangeable behind it. The
coordinate epoch needs no separate channel either, since a dynamic CRS carries
it in its own WKT.

Resolution is a computed view. Resolved transforms, injected anchor frames and
reprojected coordinates are not written back into the authored layers of the
stage being resolved; they live in a scene index, a query result, an execution
output, or a new output layer. The authored scene stays coordinate-neutral,
which is what keeps the CRS intent inspectable — once placement has been baked
into a matrix, the intent has collapsed and there is nothing left to check
against.

A resolved placement depends on more than the prim's transform stack: the
binding relationship and the prim it targets, the WKT authored there, any
coordinate epoch, the target CRS supplied by the caller, and the resources the
engine used. That set is worth stating because an implementer cannot read it off
the authored scene, and it is what a result is a function of. When to recompute
is the caller's problem, as it already is for `UsdGeomXformCache`.

That also settles what this costs a runtime that does not want it, which is
nothing. No existing transform evaluation has to change and nothing has to be
intercepted: the behavior is computed over the composed stage by something a
consumer chooses to run, so a pipeline with no interest in georeferencing behaves
exactly as it did before. Requiring a hook in the host's evaluation would be the
same mistake as authoring the reset into a layer — one puts a geospatial decision
into a code path every caller inherits, the other into data every consumer
inherits, and both spend something belonging to people who did not ask for it.

An anchor frame does establish a fresh basis: the anchor's ancestors' transforms
do not compose on top of an already-resolved world transform. Where the computed
representation has a `resetXformStack` concept, as Hydra's xform schema does,
that is where the semantic is recorded. The distinction is worth stating,
because the two can read as contradictory and are not — *not re-composing under
the parents* is required; *recording that in an authored layer* is what the
previous paragraph rules out.

Baking into a target CRS is this same evaluation with the results written out,
and produces the same world transforms as a resolve pass over the same stage
with the same target. It is not `UsdStage::Flatten()`, which merges composition
and evaluates nothing geospatial — flattening an anchor at 100 with an
independently anchored child at 20 still gives 120 where a bake gives 20.

A baked stage reproduces the resolved view with ordinary transforms, consistent
units and valid bounds, and it carries no active CRS binding that a resolver
could read as a fresh source anchor. That is the failure worth designing
against: under a source conversion that shifts by 1000 m, an anchor authored at
100 bakes correctly to 1100, and a resolver that finds the original binding
still live reads 1100 as another source coordinate and produces 2100. Comparing
the source and target WKT does not catch it, because they differ by
construction.

So the target it was baked into is recorded as ordinary provenance — the target
WKT and the output metric — rather than as a live binding with a second
"ignore this one" state layered over it. The original bindings and definitions
are kept as inert provenance, or kept in the source asset, which is the
authoritative reversible representation; the bake is the interoperable
deliverable. Capability claims are recomputed from what was delivered, so the
resolution-required declaration goes with the bindings that implied it. Changing
target later goes back to the source rather than reinterpreting provenance as a
binding.

Resolving a baked stage therefore changes nothing, and that is a property of the
representation rather than a promise. Reversibility is not: a bake that sampled
an animation, or that baked a nonlinear conversion into geometry, is not
recovered from its output, and the source asset is what covers that.

#### How closely independent runtimes agree

Exact agreement between independent implementations is not achievable, and not
worth asking for: transformation engines differ in grid handling and in
floating-point operation order. What is worth asking for is that an
implementation state how closely it agrees, as a distance in target-CRS units at
a stated coordinate magnitude. A count of matching digits is not comparable
across CRS families.

No threshold is set here. The AOUSD core specification declines to prescribe a
numerical tolerance for value resolution, on the grounds that acceptable
deviation depends on hardware, floating-point behaviour, compiler behaviour and
implementation choices. The same reasoning holds here, and one further source
applies that does not arise in value resolution: two engines can differ by
metres because they have different datum operations or different grids
available, and neither is in error.

Implementations are encouraged to measure their deviation and to state it — the
agreement achieved, in target-CRS units at a stated magnitude, and against what
it was compared. An adopter deciding whether an implementation suits their work
needs that number; they do not need it to be the same number as everyone else's,
and nothing here makes a particular number the difference between an
implementation of this schema and something else.

A stated figure means nothing without the operation that produced it, which is
why the abstraction reports which coordinate operation ran. Two implementations
differing by 2 m because they selected different datum operations and two
implementations differing by 2 m in floating-point accumulation are not the same
result, and an adopter needs to know which one they are reading. Separating
operation choice, the accuracy of the source survey, and numerical deviation is
what makes the number comparable at all.

For orientation, and not as a requirement: the survey control this data derives
from is generally good to centimetres, so agreement at the millimetre scale sits
comfortably below the accuracy of the source.

#### What a checker can catch at authoring time

Several of the ways to get this wrong are mechanically detectable in the
authored scene, which matters because a runtime description that nothing
validates against will be violated at render time. `usdchecker` is the natural
home.

| Invariant | Cost of violating it |
|---|---|
| An anchor's `xformOpOrder` is one active authored `xformOp:translate`, optionally preceded by `!resetXformStack!` | The anchor is read off a stack that does not mean what it says — 141 m for a rotation before the translate |
| A prim with a binding of its own carries that anchor translate | A binding with no position to place |
| A `crs:binding` composes to exactly one target, on a prim that carries a valid CRS definition | Resolver failure at load, or a silent choice between two CRSs made by target order |
| An unbound descendant does not reset its transform stack between itself and its anchor | 100 m, composed onto an anchor the prim does not depend on |
| Descendant offsets are authored in the frame the anchor's CRS implies | Systematic misplacement, growing with the lever |
| A stage carrying CRS bindings declares that resolution is required | Silent placement near the planet's centre |
| A stage carrying CRS bindings roots its placed content at its `defaultPrim` and binds a CRS there | Content in a sibling subtree placed outside any frame, and missing from the dependency declaration that would have warned about it |
| A stage that expects to resolve without a caller-supplied target binds a geocentric or projected CRS at its `defaultPrim` | No usable target: geographic is not a resolve target |

A coordinate-neutral authored scene is what makes these checkable at all: the
CRS intent is still present as data.

What a checker cannot key on is intent. Whether an ordinary child translation
was meant as an absolute coordinate is not in the file — `/A/D` translating 20
beneath an anchor at 100 is exactly what a correctly authored child looks like,
and flagging it, or encouraging an overriding binding to silence the flag, moves
it from 120 to 20. Magnitude does not separate the two cases either, since a
site-local CRS has small coordinates and a long asset has large offsets.
Suspicion of that kind is a warning that changes nothing by itself; every row
above is something the composed stage answers.

#### What this description does not settle

Three things are deliberately not settled here.

**The local origin.** The anchor position is authored on `xformOp:translate`.
Where a CRS is itself constructed for a site, its natural origin and the anchor
are the same point, and the position could be taken from the CRS's `CONVERSION`
parameters instead of authored. That is additive later: a CRS that supplies its
own origin lets the authored translate be omitted, and nothing written against
this description stops working.

**A geographic Target CRS.** Resolving into latitude and longitude would mean
defining what a world transform is in an angular space, since a metric offset
composed onto a position in degrees is not a linear operation and changes
meaning with latitude. This description does not cover it, and a runtime asked
for one reports that rather than producing a plausible-looking result.
Geographic CRSs remain fully supported as sources, and as an output encoding for
a point query. The Target CRS is a caller or runtime choice and is never
authored into an unresolved source scene — a baked deliverable records the
target it was baked into, as provenance — so covering this later breaks no
content.

**External grid files.** WKT2 names transformation grids — geoid grids for
vertical datums, NADCON, proprietary grids — without embedding them, so a
transform that needs one needs the file. Resolving those is not covered here. An
asset-path property on the `CoordinateReferenceSystem` prim is the natural way to carry them
and is additive: a CRS without one behaves exactly as described above.

**Units and axes that vary within a stage.** `metersPerUnit` and `upAxis` are
stage-wide in OpenUSD today, and this description reads them as authored. A CRS
that does not declare an up axis leaves it ambiguous, and composing CRSs is
where geospatial will eventually need both to vary. That is an OpenUSD question
rather than one this schema settles, and it is not a small one: every asset
written so far assumes those values are uniform across a stage, so whatever
makes them vary has to say what happens to that content.

### Default Implementation using the "PROJ" library

The OpenSource [PROJ](https://proj.org/) library can be used to create a bidirectional "transformer" object by parsing the USD WKT2 string and defining the target Coordinate Reference System (CRS) by its EPSG code.

The following sample code, using the `pyproj` library (a common Python binding for PROJ), demonstrates how to create a transformer between the Derived CRS with Affine Site Calibration WKT string provided in the document and the target EPSG:10499.

```python
import pyproj

# 1. Define the Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)

# 1a. Create a CRS object from the USD WKT string.
crs_from = pyproj.CRS.from_wkt(USD_WKT_STRING)

# 1b. Create a CRS object from the target EPSG code.
crs_to = pyproj.CRS.from_string("EPSG:10499")

# 2. Create the Transformer
transformer = pyproj.Transformer.from_crs(crs_from, crs_to)

# Example usage
target_x, target_y, target_z = transformer.transform(usd_x, usd_z, usd_y)
```

## Interaction with existing USD features

### Stage metadata: metersPerUnit and upAxis

The `metersPerUnit` stage metadata defines the unit scale
for the entire stage.
When a CRS uses units other than metres
(e.g., US survey feet for State Plane CRS),
the CRS's unit definition in the WKT string
should be consistent with `metersPerUnit`,
or the runtime must apply a unit conversion.

The `upAxis` metadata ("Y" or "Z") defines the stage's up direction.
Most geospatial CRS conventions use Z-up,
so scenes authored with geospatial CRS
should typically set `upAxis = "Z"`.

The precise interaction between stage units/axes
and CRS-defined units/axes requires further specification
and is flagged as an [open question](#open-questions).

### Transform stack and resetXformStack

A CRS-bound prim's `xformOp:translate` has to be read as an **absolute position**
in the bound CRS, not as a relative offset from its parent. Without that, USD's
standard transform concatenation adds the geospatial coordinates of parent and
child together and the world-space position is nonsense.

**The runtime applies that semantic when it resolves the binding, and the
authored scene carries no opinion about it.** `Runtime behavior` above states it
as a requirement on any implementation.

The alternative reaches the same placement and costs more than it looks.
`Bind()` calling `SetResetXformStack()` **writes `!resetXformStack!` into the
prim's `xformOpOrder` in the layer**, which puts a runtime decision into the
scene description: every consumer of that layer inherits it, changing it later
means rewriting content, and a policy that belongs in one implementation now
sits in every file ever authored against it. The cost is where the decision is
recorded, not what recording it destroys — an authored reset changes ancestor
inheritance and nothing else, and the binding and the CRS definition survive it
intact.

### Declaring the dependency

`Runtime behavior` above requires that a stage be able to declare that its correct
placement depends on CRS resolution, without saying how. In OpenUSD that mechanism
already exists: **USD Profiles**, as shipped —
[overview](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD/blob/dev/docs/user_guides/schemas/UsdProfiles/overview.md)
and [ClaimsAPI](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD/blob/dev/docs/user_guides/schemas/UsdProfiles/ClaimsAPI.md).

What is needed is a **capability**, not a profile. Profiles are tagged nodes
representing a pipeline's target; capabilities are the named features a prim relies
on, arranged in a DAG. This schema introduces one capability — resolving a CRS
binding into a placement — and nothing else.

Three properties of the mechanism make it a good fit:

- **The schema declares the implication itself.** An applied API schema names its
  implied capabilities in `customData.extraPlugInfo.impliesCapabilities` in its
  `schema.usda`; `usdGenSchema` propagates that into the library's `plugInfo.json`
  with no separate registration. So applying the binding API is what implies the
  capability, and the declaration follows from the data rather than from an author
  remembering.
- **The degradation vocabulary already says the right thing.** `UsdProfilesClaimsAPI`
  classifies each capability usage as `hard`, `soft` or `enhancement`, where `hard`
  means a consumer lacking the capability will produce incorrect results. That is
  precisely this case, and it is already generic — a consumer can act on `hard`
  without knowing what a coordinate reference system is.
- **It is derivable.** `PopulateCapabilityUsages()` walks a prim's descendants,
  queries the implied capabilities of every applied API schema, and writes the
  merged result. A pipeline step or save hook can produce the declaration; nobody
  hand-authors it.

The declaration lands in `customData` under the key `profilesInfo` on the
composed `defaultPrim`, so a consumer reads it from one known place without
traversing.

That is only a usable discovery point if what it summarizes sits beneath it, and
`PopulateCapabilityUsages()` walks descendants. A `defaultPrim` is not the
transform parent of its siblings. `/World` bound and translating 100, with a
sibling `/Other` translating 20, leaves `/Other` at 20 in ordinary USD — outside
any frame, and absent from a summary written at `/World`. An unaware consumer
reads a declaration that says nothing about the content it is about to place
wrong, and draws `/Other` at its raw numbers rather than the thousand-metre-away
position a resolve would have produced.

This version closes that by fixing the convention rather than building an
aggregation facility: **a stage's placed content is one subtree, rooted at the
composed `defaultPrim`, and that prim carries a binding.** A stage with no
`defaultPrim` designates one before the declaration means anything, and placed
content in sibling subtrees is not supported in this version.

CRS definition libraries are not placed content and sit outside that subtree.
The `/CRS` library pattern above is exactly that shape, and a rule requiring
every prim on the stage to inherit a placement binding would reject a library of
definitions for no reason. So a checker keeps two questions apart: whether the
summary covers the deliverable, and whether every placed object has an anchor
above it. They fail differently, and the first is the one an unaware consumer
depends on.

Several placed root subtrees would mean aggregating their claims at the
discovery point and validating each subtree's own anchor — a larger mechanism
than anything else here, against a convention that costs an author one reparent.
A caller-supplied target CRS is unaffected either way: the root binding says what
the source coordinates mean, which is a different question from which target a
resolve pass runs into.

#### The capability identifier

The identifier is not settled here, because it depends on a question larger than
this proposal: what an extension is called before it is ratified. This schema has
been worked in an interest group and is authored by more than one organization, so
neither a core `usd.*` token nor a single-vendor token describes it accurately. The
shipped Profiles documentation shows non-core capabilities using their own
reverse-domain prefixes and participating in the same DAG, which is the pattern to
follow.

Candidates, on the assumption that a preliminary multi-organization tier gets a
marker of its own:

| Candidate | Reading |
|---|---|
| `aousd.prelim.geospatial.crs` | Owner and tier, then a domain node and the feature beneath it |
| `aousd.prelim.crs` | Owner and tier, then a single flat domain token |

The first reserves a `geospatial` node this proposal does not fill — tiles, imagery,
point clouds and level of detail would sit beside CRS — which is either useful
groundwork or an overclaim depending on whether those are expected to follow. The
second claims only what is introduced here.

Whichever is chosen, the capability's predecessor is `usd.core`, and the move to a
ratified identifier later is a deprecation edge in the DAG rather than a break:
Profiles reports `ValidPath`, `Deprecated` and `DeprecationConflict` for exactly
this, so content authored against the preliminary name keeps resolving with a clear
status.

### Composition arcs

CRS bindings compose through standard USD composition arcs:

- **References:** CRS library prims are imported via `references`.
- **Sublayers:** CRS libraries can be included as sublayers.
- **Inherits:** CRS class prims can be inherited
  (as demonstrated in the POC implementations).
- **Payloads:** CRS bindings survive payload loading/unloading.

The standard USD composition order (LIVRPS) applies;
a stronger arc can override a weaker arc's CRS binding.

### Relationship to UsdGeom

The `CRSBindingAPI` is restricted to `UsdGeomXformable` prims.
It does not modify `UsdGeomMesh`, `UsdGeomPoints`, or other geometry schemas.
Geometry prims remain unchanged —
their vertex positions are always local offsets
relative to the nearest ancestor `Xform`.

## Industry use cases

### AECO

Building Information Modeling (BIM) workflows require
placing architectural models at surveyed site coordinates.
A hospital designed in Revit or ArchiCAD
must be positioned at its planned construction site
for clash detection, permitting, and construction coordination.

With this proposal, a BIM model exported to USD
retains its real-world position via CRS metadata,
enabling seamless integration with GIS site maps
and other geolocated assets.

### GIS and digital twins

Digital twin platforms aggregate data from dozens of sources
(LiDAR, photogrammetry, BIM, IoT sensors)
into a unified 3D view of a city, campus, or infrastructure network.
All this data arrives in various CRS —
the platform must reproject everything into a common frame.

This proposal provides the standard mechanism
for each USD layer to declare its CRS,
enabling the digital twin platform to compose and reproject
automatically rather than relying on manual coordinate transformations.

### Infrastructure and utilities

Pipeline, rail, and utility networks span hundreds of kilometres,
often crossing multiple UTM zones or State Plane regions.
A single USD stage must compose assets from different CRS zones
and display them correctly in a unified view.

The multi-CRS composition and runtime reprojection
described in this proposal directly address this use case.

### Defense and simulation

Military simulation and training environments
require precise geolocation of terrain, buildings, and vehicles
in CRS tied to national geodetic reference frames.
Dynamic datums and coordinate epochs
(supported via WKT 2's `COORDINATEMETADATA`)
are essential for high-precision positioning.

## Interoperability

### glTF geospatial extension

The Khronos Group is developing a geospatial extension for glTF
that encodes CRS metadata on nodes.
The approach is conceptually similar to this proposal
(CRS definition + binding to scene graph nodes).
Alignment between the USD and glTF approaches
would facilitate round-trip exchange between the two formats.

### IFC and BIM workflows

IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) is the open standard for BIM data.
IFC 5 is evaluating USD as a potential geometry backbone.
IFC's `IfcMapConversion` and `IfcProjectedCRS` entities
map directly to this proposal's `CoordinateReferenceSystem` and `CRSBindingAPI`.
A standard USD CRS mechanism would simplify IFC-to-USD conversion.

### CityGML and OGC 3D Tiles

CityGML and OGC 3D Tiles both carry CRS metadata.
Converting these formats to USD currently requires
discarding or side-channeling CRS information.
This proposal preserves it as first-class scene data.

## Design considerations

### Why WKT and not bare EPSG codes

The proposal uses full OGC WKT 2 strings
rather than simple EPSG integer codes for several reasons:

1. **Self-contained.**
   A WKT string carries the complete CRS definition.
   No external registry lookup is needed at runtime.

2. **Supports custom CRS.**
   Site calibration grids, local engineering CRS,
   and derived projected CRS have no EPSG code.
   WKT can represent any CRS.

3. **Authority IDs are embedded.**
   The WKT `ID["EPSG", 32611]` clause provides
   the familiar integer code for tools that prefer it,
   so nothing is lost.

4. **Dynamic datums.**
   WKT 2 supports `DYNAMIC[FRAMEEPOCH[...]]` and `EPOCH[...]`
   for time-dependent reference frames — critical for
   high-precision surveying and tectonic-plate-aware applications.

5. **ISO standard.**
   OGC WKT 2 is formally standardized as ISO 19162:2019,
   ensuring long-term stability and broad industry support.

### Why a typed prim and not stage metadata

CRS could theoretically be stored as stage-level metadata
(like `metersPerUnit`).
This was rejected because:

1. **A stage often contains multiple CRS zones.**
   Stage metadata is a single value;
   a prim-based approach supports different CRS
   at different points in the hierarchy.

2. **Composition.**
   Prim-level CRS composes through references and sublayers.
   Stage metadata has limited composition semantics.

3. **Reuse.**
   A CRS prim can be referenced by many scenes.
   Stage metadata must be duplicated.

### Alternate approaches considered

| Approach | Mechanism | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-----------|------|------|
| **A: Primvar** | `asset primvars:geolocation:crs` | Auto-inheritance via primvar system | Requires custom asset-path resolution; non-standard prim types |
| **B: String primvar + inherits** | `string primvars:geolocation:crs:wkt` + `inherits` | Simplest implementation; leverages both inherits and primvar inheritance | WKT duplicated on every inheriting prim in flattened stage |
| **C: Abstract class + plain attribute** | `class` prims with `crs:wkt` attribute | Idiomatic USD class usage | No automatic inheritance for plain attributes; requires manual parent-walking |
| **D: Typed prim + applied API (this proposal)** | `CoordinateReferenceSystem` prim + `CRSBindingAPI` | Clean separation of definition and usage; one relationship naming a shared definition; inheritance by ancestor walk | Requires new schema registration |

Approach D was selected because it provides the cleanest separation
of concerns, composes naturally through USD references,
and follows established patterns
(cf. `UsdShadeMaterialBindingAPI`).

The other approaches (A, B, C) were explored in
[proof-of-concept implementations](https://github.com/mistafunk/aousd-geospatial-pocs)
and informed the final design.

### Open questions

1. **Interaction with `metersPerUnit` and `upAxis`.**
   How should the CRS's unit definition interact with `metersPerUnit`?
   Should the runtime enforce consistency, convert automatically,
   or leave it to the authoring tool?
   The same question applies to the up axis, and this document
   currently answers it both ways: the WGS 84 ENU example encodes
   Y-up in the CRS, while the stage metadata section recommends
   `upAxis = "Z"` and the scene examples use it.
   A path forward is to decide whether the CRS may declare an up axis
   at all, or whether the stage metadata is always authoritative
   and the CRS is read in its own declared axes.

2. **Axis mapping.**
   Geospatial CRS axis orders vary
   (some are Easting/Northing, others Northing/Easting).
   How does this interact with USD's coordinate conventions?

3. **Third-party library abstraction.**
   [Runtime coordinate transformation](#runtime-coordinate-transformation)
   now gives the signature and says implementations register through
   the OpenUSD plugin system, so the shape is settled.
   A dynamic CRS carries its coordinate epoch in its own WKT
   (see [Appendix A](#appendix-a-wkt-examples)), so that needs no
   parameter of its own.
   Failure reporting is answered by
   [The transformation abstraction](#the-transformation-abstraction):
   the call returns a status, array conversion is all or nothing,
   and the status names the coordinate operation that ran.

4. **WKT validation.**
   Should OpenUSD validate WKT strings at authoring time?
   The current position is that validation is the responsibility
   of authoring tools, not the USD runtime.

5. **Single-precision geometry.**
   The float32 limitation of `point3f` is a fundamental constraint.
   Collaboration with the Geometry Working Group is needed
   to evaluate double-precision geometry support
   for geospatial-scale scenes.

6. **Reprojection performance.**
   CRS reprojection is computationally expensive.
   What caching, LOD, and batching strategies
   should the Hydra Scene Index Filter employ?

7. **glTF interop.**
   How precisely should the USD and glTF geospatial extensions align?
   Should there be a formal mapping specification?

8. **IFC 5 requirements.**
   What additional CRS features (if any)
   does IFC 5 require that are not yet covered?

### Risks

1. **WKT complexity.**
   WKT strings are verbose and easy to author incorrectly.
   Mitigation: provide standard CRS library files
   and authoring-tool validation.

2. **Third-party dependency.**
   Correct reprojection requires PROJ or an equivalent library.
   If no CRS library is available, the runtime cannot reproject.
   Mitigation: graceful degradation — CRS metadata is preserved
   even without a reprojection engine.

3. **Performance.**
   Per-prim reprojection at render time
   could be expensive for large scenes.
   Mitigation: implement caching, pre-transform at export,
   and batch reprojection in the Scene Index Filter.

4. **Adoption resistance.**
   M&E users who do not need geospatial features
   may perceive this as unnecessary complexity.
   Mitigation: the schemas are optional and additive —
   they do not affect scenes that do not use them.

## Relationship to other proposals

- **[OpenExec](../openexec/README.md):**
  Geospatial reprojection could leverage the OpenExec framework
  for deferred evaluation of CRS transformations.

- **[Semantic Schema](../semantic_schema/README.md):**
  Geospatial prims could carry semantic labels
  (e.g., "building", "road", "terrain") for GIS classification.

- **[Identifier Separation of Concerns](../identifier_separation_of_concerns/README.md):**
  BIM/GIS assets often carry source identifiers
  (IFC GlobalId, GIS feature ID) that should survive
  round-trip through USD.

- **[Revise Use of Layer Metadata](../revise_use_of_layer_metadata/README.md):**
  Relevant to the discussion of whether CRS belongs at
  the stage level vs. prim level.

   through the OpenUSD-proposals review process.

2. **Formalize the schema definition** (`schema.usda`)
   and register the `usdGeospatial` library
   in the OpenUSD build system.

3. **Settle what the transformation abstraction must carry**
   beyond coordinates — epoch, orientation, and failure reporting.

4. **Collaborate with the Geometry Working Group**
   on double-precision geometry support.

5. **Implement the Hydra 2.0 Scene Index Filter**
   for runtime CRS reprojection.

6. **Produce interoperability guidelines**
   for glTF, IFC, CityGML, and 3D Tiles exchange.

7. **Ship standard CRS library files**
   with common EPSG definitions.

8. **Make the sample WKT strings consistent**
   in their use of WKT v2 elements,
   so the same CRS is described the same way throughout.

9. **Demonstrate the accuracy claim**
   by extending the PROJ sample above
   into a worked conversion from USD coordinates
   to a national CRS, with the expected accuracy stated
   and checked.

against the case study are in [WKT examples](#wkt-examples) above.

### WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N (EPSG:32611) + EGM2008 height (EPSG:3855)

A projected CRS is two-dimensional on its own. The 3D requirement is met by
compounding it with a vertical CRS, which is what gives the third coordinate a
datum and a unit.

## Appendix B: AI-assisted drafting

This proposal was drafted with the assistance of Claude (Anthropic).
The AI was provided with the AOUSD Geospatial CRS working document,
the existing POC implementations, the usdGeospatial prototype README,
OGC standards documentation, and the OpenUSD proposals format guidelines.
All technical content was reviewed, verified,
and refined by the human authors.

## Appendix C: Reference implementations and measurements

Not part of the proposal. [Runtime behavior](#runtime-behavior) is stated on its
own terms; this appendix records the implementations it was written alongside
and what they measure, so a reader who wants the evidence behind a choice can
find it, and so an independent implementation has something to check itself
against.

The implementations themselves are listed in
[Prototype implementations](#prototype-implementations); the figures here come
from the Hydra 2.0 scene index filter and the stage-level resolver in that
table.

Every figure below comes from a runnable test rather than an estimate. The scene
behind most of them is a building in NAD83 / UTM 17N under a WGS 84 / UTM 30N
anchor, with roughly a 420 m lever from anchor to corner.

The implementations these come from convert each descendant's grid position
directly, so the figures measure frame selection and carrier equivalence and do
not include the affine approximation the world-transform contract states. Those
are separate quantities on purpose, and the one row below that is not from a
test says so.

| What was measured | Result | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Resolving an anchor as a position only, with no frame | 410 m misplacement | `test_anchor_injection.py` |
| Projected offsets lifted through a topocentric basis instead of the anchor's grid | 4.86 m misplacement | `test_coexist_vs_baked.py` |

On agreement between independent runtimes: the C++ Hydra 2.0 scene index and the
Python stage-level resolver share no runtime code, and resolve a 3,526-vertex
railway asset into the same target CRS at median 0.40 mm, worst 0.68 mm, well
inside the accuracy of the survey control behind it. Across five CRS
families and both hemispheres — UTM 18N, UTM 56S, NZTM2000, UTM 17S at the
equator, UTM 33N at 78°N — the same single code path reproduces closed-form
geodesy at 0.0 mm, with the authored EPSG code the only difference between
cases. Both run as continuous tests, on Linux and Windows.
